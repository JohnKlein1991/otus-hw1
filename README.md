This api for couriers service. It is my realm project from the work.

index.php - is front controller of this api.
Requests on this api you should make by method POST, sending specific data in XML format.

I use 2 additional packages in this project: 
<br>
vlucas/phpdotenv - for comfortable using .env config files
<br>
illuminate/database - Eloquent ORM system. I especially use not last version of this package,
 for compatibility with php7.0 which is used on production in our company.
